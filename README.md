# ECG-Nucleo

Repository for my End-of-Degree Project, which consists in the development of a electrocardiograph using a Nucleo F411 RE and an Olimex shield, and connecting it to an Android App through bluetooth to represent the signal.

The Android App uses those Free Software libraries:

Bluetooth controller: https://github.com/palaima/AndroidSmoothBluetooth

Chart programmer: https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart
